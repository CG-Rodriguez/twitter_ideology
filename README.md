This GitHub repository contains an initial release of the replication code for my working paper "Birds of a Feather Tweet Together. Bayesian Ideal Point Estimation Using Twitter Data" [<a href='https://files.nyu.edu/pba220/public/barbera_twitter_ideal_points.pdf'>Link to current draft</a>]. I will add the rest of the code and a tutorial upon publication of the article.
